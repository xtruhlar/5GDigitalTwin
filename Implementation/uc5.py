    Run UC5: Load Registration Anomaly scenario.

    Simulates a stress event in the 5G network by concurrently connecting multiple UEs. This tests the networkâ€™s ability
    to handle sudden, simultaneous registration attempts â€” a common anomaly in overloaded environments.

    Scenario Summary
        - Starts 4 UE containers simultaneously using `subprocess.Popen`.
        - Waits for all containers to fully initialize.
        - Holds all UE sessions active for a short time (5 seconds by default).
        - Stops all containers simultaneously after the wait period.
        - Logs scenario activity to 'data/current_uc.txt'.

    Args
        None

    Returns
        None
