Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the documentation for the **Digital Twin of a 5G Network** developed as part of a bachelor thesis at the Slovak University of Technology.  
This section will guide you through setting up, running, and extending the digital twin environment.

Overview
--------

This project simulates and analyzes 5G network behavior by integrating the following components:

- **Open5GS** – a full 5G core implementation.
- **UERANSIM** – emulation of multiple UE and gNBs.
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – monitoring and visualization.
- **LSTM models** – classification of network behavior using deep learning.
- **Sphinx documentation** – modular API docs.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+ and `venv`  
- Git
- At least 16 GB RAM (recommended for full stack simulation)
